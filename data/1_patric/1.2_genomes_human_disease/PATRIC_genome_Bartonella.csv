Carrion¿¿¿s disease has two different clinical phases. During the phase also called ¿¿¿Oroya fever¿¿¿, B. bacilliformis  invades red blood cells and produces severe hemolytic anemia. The chronic phase, also known as ¿¿¿verruga peruana¿¿¿, is characterized by skin nodules and mulaire lesions, which usually bleed and leads to fibrosis. The complete genome sequencing of  B. bacilliformis  strain INS will provide insight into the genes involved in virulence,  moreover specific  genes  from B.  bacilliformis that could be useful in  the development of vaccines to achieve protection against Carrion¿¿¿s disease.",,99.9,99.8,100,,,"Good","2014-12-08T22:10:25.407Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"
